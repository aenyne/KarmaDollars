# KarmaDollars
I am not sure, how to do this, but I want to build a platform, where initiatives and NGOs can ask for specific help or projects, that people do without paying. The reward for completing projects would be "Karma Tokens". I the best vision, we can achieve cooperation with some companies where Karma Tokens can be used for paying.  

I will start by creating an app for initiatives, where they can schedule and manage activities.
