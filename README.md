# KarmaDollars is a Delta Project
I want to build a platform, where initiatives and NGOs can ask for specific help or projects and reward for completing these projects with "Karma Dollars". In the best vision, we can achieve cooperation with some companies where Karma Tokens can be used for getting discounts, priority access or specific rewards.  

I would be happy to lead this project as OpenSource project, and receive help and funding where possible.

What the app should be doing:

for the organizations: directory 
- add people of the organization to it, incl. # to search for their qualifications
- putting people into groups
- assigning working hours or projects to them (e.g. every month or year 10 hours)
- checking out these hours (to see how many they have spent on specific project, etc.)
- converting hours into tokens

for helpers:
- create profile, with # of their qualifications
- see your rating among others / in your team
- search with GPS and # for organisations to help, get proposals
- get proposals from people who are searching a teammate
- see wallet
- calendar scheduling and synchronizing with your own


for both: calendar function
- create projects and subdivide them to work parts, that can be scheduled into a calendar
- scheduling meetings etc.
- synchronizing with phone calendar

for both: chatting function
- should work rather like slack, with some general channels, but also project specific channels

for helpers: wallet
- for the tokens
- smart contracts to convert hours into tokens
- sharing / sponsoring of tokens? exchanging against help?

for organizations: wallet
- enter requested hours, mine the tokens once the hours were checked out
- necessary process to mitigate risk of abuse (not really doing social work, not doing work at all, etc)
- limit how many hours one can post? maybe by some kind of user rating of the organization?
- sharing / sponsoring our your hours to other organizations?

rating / game issues
- some kind of gamification topics like, 10 hours / week challenge or do 30 mins every day challenge
- some kind of team challenge (team vs team)
- top ten of the week etc
- share your profile on social media

data
- I wand to have this solution as a decentralized app. the data, esp the tokens should be not dependent on a central solution, so we need some kind of a DL technology
- dfinity?

price:
- payment provided by funding, organizations or corporations that work with us
- helpers can join without providing payment
- corporations could claim that they take responsibility in social projects and therefore use this to develop their branding and social accounts
- helpers can easily help without much bureaucracy, find organizations in the near
- more transparency for media and NGOs what actually happens, more media coverage
- more just than intrinsic motivation to help, but in best case also a "reward" in terms of dollars


# The Delta Project - Manifest
My aim is to use state-of-the-art technology to make the world more caring and social. We will use the knowdledge about the functions of the psychology, neurology, about economics, educationa and soialization to achieve improvements towards more wealth, health, caring for every living, now and in future. I understand that this is an incremental process. Every little step will create change towards the better.
